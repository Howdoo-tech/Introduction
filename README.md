# Howdoo

Leveraging the block chain and distributed technologies, Howdoo is a social media platform that allows large, ad-hoc groups of users to share value between themselves without the involvement of any centralized authority. Using public-key cryptography across the network, users, content creators, network operators, advertisers, and third party partners can transfer cryptotokens across the network. As a result, the uDoo (the Howdoo cryptotoken) acts as the means of value exchange for the platform, with each individual sequence of block transactions committed using a consistent proof of work scheme. Howdoo’s vision is to be a mass-adoption product for today’s cryptocurrency and block chain world. It aims to improve upon existing block chain applications such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum’s EVM, whilst ensuring it avoids the issues associated with these environments.
